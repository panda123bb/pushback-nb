“Hoard bots”, or bots that can carry 12 or more blocks. These bots are intended to make quick plays that completely replace all the blocks present in a long goal.

A common problem in gameplay that hoard bots face is that itpromotes selfish strategies. Where the quick plays to replace the blocks in the long goals are obvious to other drivers. Who only need to coordinate and hold an end of the long goal.

An interesting strategy to take advantage of the hoard, would be to color sort for the opposite alliance’s blocks; keeping said blocks in the cart. The intended effect would be to encourage other bots to copy, in a race to the bottom endgame. Where points are now completely dependent on how teams perform their parking. Giving more control to the alliance.
